With Datatoggle, anyone can add a destination (like Mixpanel) in a few clicks and without code.

Why Datatoggle ?
* **API compatible with Segment**
* **Free**, without limit on users or number of tracked events
* **Open source**
* **Serverless**


## Getting Started

Get started by **creating a new site**.

Or **try Docusaurus immediately** with **[docusaurus.new](https://docusaurus.new)**.

## Generate a new site

Generate a new Docusaurus site using the **classic template**:

```shell
npm init docusaurus@latest my-website classic
```

## Start your site

Run the development server:

```shell
cd my-website

npx docusaurus start
```

Your site starts at `http://localhost:3000`.

Open `docs/intro.md` and edit some lines: the site **reloads automatically** and display your changes.
