# Page

The `page` call lets you record whenever a user sees a page of your website, along with any optional properties about the page.


Its API is identical to the equivalent Segment [page](https://segment.com/docs/connections/spec/page/) function.

`````javascript
datatoggle.page('Home', {
    title: "Welcome",
    url: "http://www.example.com"
})
`````
