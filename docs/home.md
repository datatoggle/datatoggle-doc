Datatoggle is a **Serverless Customer Data Platform**.

Like other CDPs, It provides:
* A standard API, **compatible with Segment**, to collect data from your website and send it
  everywhere.
* A dashboard, to add a destination in a few clicks.

Unlike other CDPs, routing to destinations is done directly in the browser. Because we don't need servers to process your data, **Datatoggle is completely free**, without quota on the number of users or events. Datatoggle is also **open source**.
